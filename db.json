      "description": "Recognizing drought risks in a timely manner is dependent on our ability to monitor and forecast the diverse physical indicators of climatological drought, as well as relevant economic, social, and environmental impacts. A DEWS provides accurate, timely, and integrated information on drought conditions at the relevant spatial scale. This can help governments and communities make proactive decisions to minimize the economic, social, and ecosystem losses associated with drought.",
